# Performance Audit — 2025-10-16

## Lighthouse
- Mobile (`docs/perf/lighthouse-report.json`): performance 69, SEO 92, accessibility 100, best practices 77.
- Desktop (`docs/perf/lighthouse-report-desktop.json`): performance 99, SEO 92, accessibility 100, best practices 77.

## Shopify Theme Inspector
- `shopify theme profile --url / --json`  
  ↳ failed locally (`Maximum call stack size exceeded`). Store access credentials or Theme Access token required to continue.

## Follow-up
- Deploy the updated theme, then re-run Lighthouse (mobile focus) to validate that inlined critical CSS lifts the performance score toward the ≥90 target.
- Re-attempt Shopify Theme Inspector once store credentials / Theme Access token are available; capture and archive the Speedscope profile in `docs/perf/`.
