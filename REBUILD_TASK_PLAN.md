# üöÄ KULKID THEME REBUILD - MASTER ACTION PLAN

**Status:** Ready to Execute  
**Timeline:** ~5 hours total (spread over 1-2 days)  
**Goal:** Clean, working theme with functional variant switching, image galleries, and maintainable codebase

---

## **üõ°Ô∏è SAFE DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**

**Key Decision: DISCONNECT live theme from Git during rebuild**
- ‚úÖ **Live theme stays untouched** during entire rebuild process
- ‚úÖ **Build clean version in draft themes** only
- ‚úÖ **Manual deployment** when everything perfect
- ‚úÖ **Zero risk** to live site

**Git ‚Üí Shopify Mapping:**
```bash
# During Rebuild:
"KULKID Live" (current)      ‚Üí  [DISCONNECTED from Git - stays stable]
"KULKID Clean v2" (draft)    ‚Üí  Our rebuild work (staging branch)
"Feature Tests" (draft)      ‚Üí  Individual feature testing

# After Rebuild:
main (protected)             ‚Üí  Manual deployment only
staging                     ‚Üí  "KULKID Staging" theme
feature/*                   ‚Üí  "Feature Tests" themes
```

---

## **PHASE 1: BACKUP & ASSESSMENT** ‚è±Ô∏è 30 mins
**üë§ Your Tasks**

### **A. Export Current Data & Disconnect**
```bash
# In Shopify Admin
1. Online Store ‚Üí Themes ‚Üí Live Theme ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Export
2. Settings ‚Üí Export theme settings to JSON  
3. Note down current app configurations
4. CRITICAL: Ensure live theme is NOT connected to GitHub/Git auto-deploy
```

### **B. Document What Works**
- ‚úÖ **Brand styling** (colors, fonts, logos)
- ‚úÖ **Working sections** (which custom sections actually work well?)
- ‚úÖ **Essential pages** (which page templates are customized?)
- ‚úÖ **Apps list** (Search & Discovery, Klaviyo, Printify, etc.)

### **C. Create Reference Screenshots**
- Homepage layout

- Collection page layout
- Key custom sections

**‚úÖ COMPLETION CRITERIA:** 
- [ ] Theme exported and downloaded
- [ ] Settings JSON saved
- [ ] Working features documented
- [ ] Screenshots taken
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Verified live theme is NOT auto-deploying from Git
- [ ] Current Git state tagged as "pre-rebuild-backup"

---

## **PHASE 2: CLEAN REPOSITORY SETUP** ‚è±Ô∏è 45 mins
**ü§ñ My Tasks**

### **A. Repository Safety & Backup**
```bash
# I will execute:
# 1. First ensure current work is preserved
git add -A && git commit -m "FINAL BACKUP: Complete state before rebuild"
git tag "pre-rebuild-backup" # Tag for easy recovery

# 2. Create clean Dawn foundation
cd /tmp && git clone https://github.com/Shopify/dawn.git dawn-fresh
cd dawn-fresh && git checkout main
cd /home/ben/projects && mv kulkid kulkid-backup
mv /tmp/dawn-fresh kulkid && cd kulkid
```

### **B. Professional Git Structure**
```bash
# NEW Branch Strategy (Production-Safe):
main (protected)           # Stable code, manual deploy only
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dawn-base             # Pristine Dawn reference
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging               # Pre-production testing ("KULKID Clean v2")
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ theme-custom          # Development branch
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/*             # Individual features
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/*              # Emergency fixes only

# Branch Protection Rules:
- main: Requires PR approval, no direct pushes
- staging: Automatic deployment to draft theme
- feature/*: Isolated testing environments
```
